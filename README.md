Since Huawei restricts access to the latest BIOS updates to their own technical engineers, I located the corresponding files for the [Huawei RH2288H V3](https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/servers/rh2288h-v3-pid-9901881) on [ServeTheHome forum](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/huawei-servers-resources-rh2288hv3-5288v3.36555/) and have backed them up to assist others who may need them.
